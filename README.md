# RAG-Language-Model (Retrieve and Generate)

## Overview

This project utilizes the Retrieve and Generate (RAG) architecture to answer questions based on documents stored in a vector database. It retrieves relevant documents from a Qdrant vector store and uses a language model to generate precise answers. The model is deployed using Groq and other advanced tools to create a seamless and efficient retrieval-augmented generation pipeline.

## Features

- **Question Answering**: The core functionality of the project is to answer questions by retrieving relevant context from a vector database and generating answers using an advanced language model.
- **Qdrant Vector Store**: Uses the Qdrant vector store to store, search, and retrieve the most relevant documents for answering a question.
- **Custom Prompting**: A customized prompt template is designed to format and pass retrieved documents along with the question to the model.
- **Multi-Tool Integration**: The project integrates multiple tools like LangChain, Groq, and Hugging Face embeddings.

## Technologies

- **Qdrant**: A vector search engine that stores and indexes vectors.
- **Groq**: High-performance AI models for running queries and generating answers.
- **LangChain**: Framework for building NLP pipelines.
- **Sentence Transformers**: For generating document embeddings.
- **Hugging Face**: For leveraging transformer-based language models.
